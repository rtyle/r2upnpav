r2upnpav

Remote (via infrared and/or HDMI CEC transport) to UPnP AV protocol adapter

See makefile for requirements and building.
See install.* scripts for example installations.
install.archlinux was used for an HDMI-CEC archlinux based adapter.
install.ubuntu was used for an infrared ubuntu based adapter
which was converted to fedora (and installed with install.fedora).

See embedded man page (./r2upnpav --man) for details,
from which the following was extracted:

NAME
       r2upnpav - Remote to UPnP AV protocol adapter

SYNOPSIS
       r2upnpav [Option]...

DESCRIPTION
	Convert remote control codes
	relayed from a HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) equipment or
	received from the Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC) daemon (lircd)
	(and adapted by program specific LIRC Run Commands (lircrc))
	to Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Audio/Video (AV) device operations.

	A libcec compatible HDMI CEC protocol adapter must be installed
	to relay remote/button codes from your remote.
	Specify --cec=- if there is no such input.

	The LIRC daemon (lircd) must be configured (and running)
	to receive remote/button codes for your remote.
	These remote/button codes must then be adapted/configured
	(by way of a lircrc file specified on the command line
	or found in one of the default locations)
	to operations supported by this program (r2upnpav).
	Specify --lircrc=- if there is no such input.

	The UPnP media renderer device(s) to be targeted by each operation
	are specified as those whose friendly names
	match a renderer regular expression pattern.

	Use the verbose program option to trace program operations.
	This includes UPnP device discovery with device friendly names
	reported for all available devices.
	Once these names are known, one should be able to specify a pattern
	to match only the device(s) of interest.
	If nothing is discovered, make sure the correct network interface
	is chosen and that UPnP network protocols are not firewalled.
	With use with a firewall, a rule to allow traffic from the local
	network to the specified UPnP TCP SOAP server port should be added.
	Unfortunately, for UPnP discovery, an ephemeral UDP port is used.
	Since this port cannot be known/specified in advance, the firewall
	must allow all UDP incoming traffic to the ephemeral port range.

Options:
  -h [ --help ]          Print options usage.
  -m [ --man ]           Print man(ual) page.
  -c [ --cec ] arg       CEC adapter com port (see cec-client -l output) 
                         (default: ); "" => default, "-" => no CEC input.
  -i [ --interface ] arg UPnP network (default: first non LOOPBACK interface).
  -l [ --lircrc ] arg    lircrc file (default: ); "" => default, "-" => no lirc
                         input.
  -n [ --name ] arg      CEC OSD name (default: r2upnpav).
  -p [ --program ] arg   lircrc program tag (default: r2upnpav).
  -r [ --renderer ] arg  renderer pattern (default: (?i).*\s-\ssonos\s.*).
  -s [ --server ] arg    UPnP TCP SOAP server port (default: 0); 0 => any 
                         port).
  -t [ --timeout ] arg   CEC connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 
                         10000).
  -v [ --verbose ]       Print trace messages.

LIRCRC EXAMPLES
	The following lircrc file maps typical (standard, irrecord named)
	lircd (remote/button) codes to supported (config'ed)
	program (r2upnpav) operations:
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_PAUSE
			config	= Pause
			repeat	= 0
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_PLAY
			config	= Play
			repeat	= 0
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_REWIND
			config	= Previous
			repeat	= 0
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_FASTFORWARD
			config	= Next
			repeat	= 0
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_MUTE
			config	= Mute
			repeat	= 0
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_VOLUMEUP
			config	= VolumeUp
			repeat	= 1
		end
		begin
			prog	= r2upnpav
			button	= KEY_VOLUMEDOWN
			config	= VolumeDown
		 	repeat	= 1
		end
